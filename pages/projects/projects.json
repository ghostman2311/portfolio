The initial version of my upcoming podcast app used this library extensively.\n\nIt does not add additional syntactic sugar to the existing HTML syntax of a site (unlike _Vue.js_ or _Svelte_). It is largely made up of utility functions written in vanilla JavaScript with some JQuery thrown-in (for stuff like changing out contents of an element, performing data calls, etc). My own custom utility CSS stylesheets also work hand-in-hand with this library to provide pre-designed UI elements.",
